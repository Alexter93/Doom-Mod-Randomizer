# Doom-Mod-Randomizer
A simple program that starts the classic 1993 PC game with a random mod (game and mods not included). You will have to modify the code in the current build to match the file paths to your iWad and source port. After that, the porgram is user friendly, and it will be even more so in the future. Also the Mods you select are saved after terminating the program and reloaded upon startup.
